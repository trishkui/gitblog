   <h1>1.Get started</h1> 


   <p>
    Set up your development environment and create all the necessary files and folders.

   <h1>2.What is Git</h1>
   <p>
    Git is a version control system.
    A version control system (VCS) is a tool that helps you manage changes to files over time. 
    Why is Version Control Important?
    Backup and Safety: If something goes wrong, you can always go back to a previous version.
    Collaboration: Multiple people can work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.
    Tracking Changes: You can see who made what changes and when.
    Experimentation: You can try out new ideas without the fear of ruining the original project because you can always revert back.
    Other Version Control Systems Like Git
    Git is one of many version control systems, but it’s by far the most popular. Here are a few others:
    Subversion (SVN): A centralized version control system where the history is stored on a single server.
    Mercurial: Similar to Git, it's a distributed version control system but is designed to be simpler.
    Perforce: Often used in large enterprises, it also focuses on version control but with a centralized approach.
    While these tools have their merits, Git stands out for its speed, flexibility, and popularity. That’s why many developers and teams worldwide use Git in their daily workflows.
    By the end of this post, you'll have a solid understanding of how to set up and use Git, along with GitHub, to manage your own projects!

<h2>3.Installing Git </h2>
    <p>
       First check if git is installed in your machine.To check that open your command prompt and type:
        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git --version</code>

        <h2>5.Initializing a Git Repository</h2>
      <p>
        A git repository is a directory where Git tracks changes to files.To initialize your repository open your command prompt and type:
        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git init </code>
        <img src="/images/image4.png">
        </p>
        <h2>5.Adding files to the staging area</h2>
      <p>
        The staging area is is where you prepare files to be commited.open your command prompt and type:
        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git add .</code>

        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git commit -m"Your commit message" </code>
        To view past commits:
        git log
        To revert to a particular commit:
        git checkout commit_hash>

        </p>
        <h2>7.Creating a Branch</h2>
        <h3>Branches</h3>
      <p>
       Branches are one of git features where it allows you to work on different versions of your project simultaneously.They are essential for manaing features and fixes separately.To create a new branch open your command prompt and type:
        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git branch branch_name </code>
        <img src="/images/image7.png">
        </p>
        <h2>8.Viewing all branches</h2>
      <p>
        To view all branches and see the active oney open your command prompt and type:
        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git branch </code>
        <img src="/images/image8.png">
        </p>
        h2>9.Switching Active Branches</h2>
      <p>
        By default the active branch is Master to change that open your command prompt and type:
        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git switch branch_name</code>
        <img src="/images/image9.png">
        </p>
        <h2>10.Merging a branch</h2>
      <p>
        Merge changes from one branch into another example merging the created branch with the master branch with open your command prompt and type:
        <br><code style="font-size: large;"> git merge branch_name </code>
        <img src="/images/image10.png">
        </p>
        <h2>11.Deleting a branch</h2>
      <p>

        </p>
        <h2>12.Have some fun</h2>
      <p>
        Delve into more advanced Git features, such as rebasing and stashing, to enhance your version control skills. Additionally, learn how to seamlessly integrate Git with GitHub for efficient remote collaboration and code management..
        </p>
        <h2>13.Deploy your page</h2>
      <p>
      Deploy your page to hosting platform like https://pages.github.com/.<br>
